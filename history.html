          <h3>My History</h3>

          <br>
          <h5>under 12</h5>
          <p class="image-history"><img src="#"></p>
          <p class="sentence">I was born in Kyoto ciry, Japan in 1998. </p>
          <p class="sentence">Since my mother is a music teacher, I went to Musicals and Operas so many times.</p>
          <p class="sentence">That's why I love to sing and listen to music even now.</p>
          <p class="sentence">When I was elementary student, there was a test of science. In that test, everyone except
            me could not get
            100% score and I was praised by my teacher.</p>
          <p>That was very happy event, so after that, I started studying hard in order to get as high score as I can.
          </p>
          <p>There's another thing to notice. There was a Ekiden competition of all elementary schools in Kyoto-city.
          </p>
          <p>I was one of the team which represent my school. The result was not good. We couldn't go to the final.</p>
          <p>That also made me decide to belong to track&field club in junior high school.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12 histories">

          <h5>junior high school and high school</h5>
          <p class="image-history"><img src="#"></p>
          <p class="sentence">Thanks to the effort and luck I had, I could enter famous junior high school in Kyoto.</p>
          <p class="sentence">The school system was six-year high school education system, so I spent 6 years in that
            school.</p>
          <p class="sentence">As I said before, I decided to belong to track&field club and I mainly ran 1500m or 800m.
          </p>
          <p class="sentence">In the first year, I could not do English test well and i had to do the supplementary
            lesson with my
            teacher.</p>
          <p class="sentence">However after that, I got used to use English and I became to be able to get high score in
            English exam.
          </p>
          <p>In the third year, I went to Australia ( that was first time I went abroad) and I was so fascinated by the
            magnificent and beautiful nature, interesting culture, and indegenous food.</p>
          <p>After the experience, I really wanted to go anywhere I can and experience such a new world.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I went to Fiji and Canada for a month to study English and feel other cultures.</p>
          <p>That deepened my knowledge of English and other culture.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12 histories">

          <h5>University era</h5>
          <p class="image-history"><img src="#"></p>
          <p class="sentence">While learning English, One thing came up with my mind, "I want to learn other language!"
          </p>
          <p class="sentence">Then, I love to watch Opera and Musical, so I decided to learn German language as my
            major, in order to be
            able to understand what they sing or say in Opera and Musical.</p>
          <p class="sentence">Learning German was so hard to me, because at that time I am interested in a cappella club
            activity and I
            worked a lot as a part-time job.</p>
          <p class="sentence">However, fortunately, I passed the test and I was choosen as a exchange student to Goethe
            University, which
            is located in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
          <p>From September 2019, I stayed in the domitory and I started new life in Germany.</p>
          <p>There were so many difficulties such as culture-shock and the language-barrier, but I gradually got
            accustomed to the life in Germany.</p>
          <p>When the time to go back to Japan came in March 2020, I really missed the life in Germany.</p>
          <p>Then the Covid-era came.</p>
          <p>I did not know what to do and in which industry I should work, so I decided to do anything I want.</p>
          <p>I played the guiter, I started learning Chinese, and the last thing I started was programming.</p>
          <p></p>
